	           <p>All round development essentially means intellectual, physical, moral, sensible, and social development to fulfill those objectives, there is a prime need of striking balance between syllabus, curriculum, books and also co-curricular activities beyond that.</p>
	           <p>Chinese proverb very aptly states, <strong>"Teach me, and I will forget. Show me, and I might remember. Involve me, and I will never forget."</strong> To a very great extent, the theoretical knowledge is enhanced when a co-curricular activity related to the content taught, is organized. Intellectual development of the personality is achieved to a great extent, in the classroom itself. But, the aesthetic development like character building, spiritual and moral values, physical growth, creativity and many more are backed up by co-curricular activities.
				<p>There is a huge plethora of options that a student can choose from. Take a little glance at some options that one can choose from.</
