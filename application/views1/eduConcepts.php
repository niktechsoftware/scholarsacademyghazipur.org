                                                OUTSTANDING EDUCATORS  When all factors are considered, the teacher has the single, greatest impact on a child's development. This is why attracting and retaining the finest educators is a top priority

PARENT INVOLVEMENT  Recognizing the role the family plays in a child's academic and social development, we engage parents in the learning process. Parents contribute at least 20 hours of service to their school every year.

WELL-ROUNDED STUDENTS  Superior educational models recognize the importance of developing the whole child with parental involvement. Our curriculum also incorporates a character development program.
